To determine how skill and chance play a role in team performance, and also predict who would win 2024 March Madness, we decided to take the following approach:

1)  identify a rational metric of team skill.

2)  model team wins as a function of skill under informative priors.

3)  determine to what extent wins could be explained by team skill and how much was left to chance. determine who would win March Madness 2024 under our model.
